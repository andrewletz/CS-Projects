In this example, we can pipeline the the loads and mult, but we can't pipeline the add because it depends on 
values from the previous iteration (sum in %xmml).
The critical path here follows through the float multiplication (CPE disregarded due to pipelining) which is then float-added to 
the previous sum (CPE of 3). This means that the lower latency bound in terms of CPE is 3 cycles.

Looking at the data, the 4 way loop unrolled version of this loop works an average of 1.3x faster than the 
standard loop, ranging from 1.1x to 1.8x times faster depending on the number of elements. I assume this would
get even larger in difference if the number of elements went into the billions (or more).
