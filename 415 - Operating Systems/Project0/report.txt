My current solution appears to be fully functional.
May be a bit on the slow side due to the use of recursion for inorder
searches in the BST, but should run within reasonable time.
Included a few helper functions in my tldmap implementation.

Credit given to Cormen's Intro to Algorithms 3rd edition for BST pseudo-implementation, and Dr. Sventek for his queue and stack ADTs as outlines. Also utilized IBMs <strings.h> library for case insensitive string compare.
