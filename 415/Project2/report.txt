Report:
I ran the final version for over 20 minutes with no packet leaks. It wobbles around
24 out, 12 free for most of execution.
The requested diagrams are included in PDF format along with their explanations.

The calculations for buffer sizing is as follows:
|SQ| = size of send queue
|P| = size of pool
sum(|BB|) = sum of sizes of application BBs
x = |SQ| + |P| + sum(|BB|)
if size(FPDS) / 2 <= x <= size(FPDS), then

To keep the most packet descriptors out at once without having 0 free, I chose an x value of sizeof(FPDS).
The pool (cache) should be small in comparison to the FPDS, so a value of (2/10) of x seems reasonable.
The send queue and application bounded buffers can be split evenly between the rest of the space, meaning each receives (4/10)s of x (which is (4/10)s the size of the FPDS).
This means each application BB will receive approximately 3.6% of the FPDS each (with 11 applications).

This can be seen implemented in the init function where each BB is assigned a size.
