Credit/acknowledgement of assistance:
- Several functions provided by Roscoe Casita
	- These specific credits can be found in respective source files
- Several functions from Elegant C Programming, guidance from Dr. Sventek's
Piazza posts and lectures
- Ethan Quick provided several high-level concept clarifications, but
no actual code at any point

Report:
Notes: several abstractions have been made to different files.
uspsfxns: Includes things such as readin, donanosleep, getwordcount, etc.
	that are used by all usps versions. Also includes all #includes. (hehe)
pcontrol: Linked list implementation and wrapper designed for this project.
p1fxns: Provided by Dr. Sventek, used on numerous occasions.
Makefile: Should compile all my code correctly.

Status of each usps:
uspsv1: This works 100% as intended. All input cases have
been tested, and no memory leaks have been found in the final version.

uspsv2: code state is the same as uspsv1.

uspsv3: code state is the same as uspsv1&2.
Implemented using 2 LLs (ready queue and exited), and one free Pcb pointer.
No frees/mallocs inside of sigalarm.

uspsv4: code state is the same as uspsv1&2&3.
Shares all code with uspsv3 apart from the proc printing function.

I tried to include good documentation for every function, and much of the code.
test_script.sh was ran against my final versions several times without issue.
