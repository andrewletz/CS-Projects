# CS-Projects

### CS 461: Compiler Construction

### CS 441: Graphics

### CS 433: Computer and Network Security

### CS 425: Programming Languages

### CS 422: Software Methodologies

### CS 415: Operating Systems

Summary of the main projects in operating systems (all in C):
* created a searchable map structure with an iterator for top level domains, using ADTs in C. Implemented as a BST.
* created a user-space-process-scheduler: took either a file or cmd-line input to load in a list of commands to be executed in a round robin style execution. Found information about these processes from the /proc file system.
* built a PThread based network driver (simulated) for handling packets.
Throughout these all, used debugging tools like Valgrind (for memory leaks) and gdb (for everything else).

### CS 399: Data Science

### CS 330: C/C++ & Unix

Finally installed Linux on my laptop. Learned terminal commands, improved my Git abilities, learned C++, improved my C, and created a solid game as a final group project (BG3, public repo on my profile).

### CS 315: Intermediate Algorithms

Mostly written assignments, small amounts of programming done in Python. Things covered included BFS, DFS, matrices, bipartite algorithms, Djikstras, longest/shortest path, a huge focus on Dynamic Programming, and more.

### CS 314: Computer Organization

First big intro to C and how computers really work. Learned the intricate details of CPUs, main memory and hard drives, how to optimize code for a computer, some x86, and a lot of C.

### CS 313: Intermediate Data Structures

Exploring more theoretical topics, data structures was about linked lists, stacks, queues, p-queues, matching brackets, binary trees, heaps, RB-trees, hashing, tears, etc. Assignments were either written or done in Python for ease.

### CS 212: Introduction to Computer Science III

Switching to Java (my most familiar language), this class focused on OOP with an introduction to multithreading.

### CS 211: Introduction to Computer Science II

Building on CS 210, this class used Python to build fundamentals but also introduced the use of new tools (Jupyter notebooks and SQL).

### CS 210: Introduction to Computer Science I

This class focused on an intro to CS topics with all projects done in Python.
